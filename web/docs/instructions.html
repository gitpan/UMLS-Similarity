    <h1>Similarity web interface instructions</h1>

    <p>Enter the terms or Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) whose similarity or 
      relatedness you wish to compute into the fields labeled <em>Term 1</em> and 
      <em>Term 2</em>.  You can enter any combination of terms or CUIs. For example:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>heart attack and skull</li>
      <li>C0018563 and C0037303</li>
      <li>hand and C0037303</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can than either calculate the two terms similarity or relatedness. Semantic 
      similarity measures quantify how ``alike'' (or similar)  two concepts are by 
      determining their closeness in a hierarchy. Semantic relatedness measures quantify 
      the degree of semantic feature overlap between two terms. Two terms may be related 
      (needle-thread) but not necessarily similar. 
      </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the similarity you have two options: 
      <ol>
	<li>SAB which designates  what UMLS source to obtain the hierarchical 
	  information</li>
	<li>REL which designates what relation information to use from the 
	  designated source</li>
	</ol>
    </p>
    <p> To calculate hte relatedness you also have two options: 
      <ol>
	<li>SABDEF which designates what UMLS sources to obtain the definitions from</li>
	<li>RELDEF which designates what relations to use to create the extended 
	  definiton</li>
	</ol>
