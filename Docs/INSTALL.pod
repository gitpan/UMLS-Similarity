=head1 INSTALLATION 

If you have the super-user access, then you can install SenseClusters 
into system directories via :
	
		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make install
	 	make clean

The exact location of where UMLS-Similarity will be installed 
dependson your system configuration. A message will be printed 
out aftermake install telling your exactly where it was installed. 

If you do not have authority to write into system directories, you can
install SenseClusters in a local directory that you own and have permissions 
to read and write into as follows:

		perl Makefile.PL PREFIX = /YOUR/DIR
		make
		make install
		make clean

This will install the UMLS-Similarity programs into 

		/YOUR/DIR/bin/

and man pages into 

		/YOUR/DIR/share/man/ (Linux)
		/YOUR/DIR/man/       (Solaris)
