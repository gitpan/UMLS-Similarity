NAME
    UMLS::Interface CHANGES

  Changes from version 0.11 to 0.13
    Added two new semantic similarity measure modules: i) nam.pm which is an
    implemantion of the semantic similarity measure described by Nguyan and
    Al-Mubaid, 2006 and ii) cdist.pm which is the Conceptual Distance
    measure described by Rada, et. al., 1989.

    Modified the umls-similarity.pl utility program to incorporate the
    nam.pm and cdist.pm similarity modules.

  Changes from version 0.09 to 0.11
    Allow the umls-similarity.pl program to obtain the semantic similarity
    between a term and CUI as well as CUI-CUI and term-term pairs.

    Added some error checking to the umls-similarity.pl program and the
    measure modules.

  Changes from version 0.07 to 0.09
    Removed the queryUMLS.pl module and put in its place umls-similarity.pl.
    This does exactly what the original queryUMLS.pl does but it also now
    accepts files and is much nicer.

    Added the similarity measure described by Wu and Palmer (1994)
