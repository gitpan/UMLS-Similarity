NAME
    UMLS::Interface CHANGES

  Changes from version 0.13 to 0.15
    Modified the output of umls-similarity so that if a concept doesn't
    exist you can tell which one it is. I also added a --verbose option
    which gives a little more information about the concept that doesn't
    exist.

    Modified the wup.pm module. The Wu and Palmer measure is twice the depth
    of the two concepts LCS divided by the product of the the depths of the
    individual concepts. I was using the minimum depths of these concepts
    where as I should have been using the depth of the path that contained
    the LCS itself.

  Changes from version 0.11 to 0.13
    Added two new semantic similarity measure modules: i) nam.pm which is an
    implemantion of the semantic similarity measure described by Nguyan and
    Al-Mubaid, 2006 and ii) cdist.pm which is the Conceptual Distance
    measure described by Rada, et. al., 1989.

    Modified the umls-similarity.pl utility program to incorporate the
    nam.pm and cdist.pm similarity modules.

  Changes from version 0.09 to 0.11
    Allow the umls-similarity.pl program to obtain the semantic similarity
    between a term and CUI as well as CUI-CUI and term-term pairs.

    Added some error checking to the umls-similarity.pl program and the
    measure modules.

  Changes from version 0.07 to 0.09
    Removed the queryUMLS.pl module and put in its place umls-similarity.pl.
    This does exactly what the original queryUMLS.pl does but it also now
    accepts files and is much nicer.

  Changes from version 0.05 to 0.07
    Added the similarity measure described by Wu and Palmer (1994)
