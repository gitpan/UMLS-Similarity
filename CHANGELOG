NAME
    UMLS::Interface CHANGES

  Changes from version 0.09 to 0.11
    Allow the umls-similarity.pl program to obtain the semantic similarity
    between a term and CUI as well as CUI-CUI and term-term pairs.

    Added some error checking to the umls-similarity.pl program and the
    measure modules.

  Changes from version 0.07 to 0.09
    Removed the queryUMLS.pl module and put in its place umls-similarity.pl.
