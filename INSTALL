INSTALLATION
    If you have the super-user access, then you can install SenseClusters
    into system directories via :

                    perl Makefile.PL
                    make
                    make install
                    make clean

    The exact location of where UMLS-Similarity will be installed dependson
    your system configuration. A message will be printed out aftermake
    install telling your exactly where it was installed.

    If you do not have authority to write into system directories, you can
    install SenseClusters in a local directory that you own and have
    permissions to read and write into as follows:

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX = /YOUR/DIR
                    make
                    make install
                    make clean

    This will install the UMLS-Similarity programs into

                    /YOUR/DIR/bin/

    and man pages into

                    /YOUR/DIR/share/man/ (Linux)
                    /YOUR/DIR/man/       (Solaris)
