UMLS-Similarity
    This package consists of Perl modules along with supporting Perl
    programs that implement the semantic similarity and relatedness measures
    described by Leacock & Chodorow (1998), Wu & Palmer (1994), Nguyen and
    Al-Mubaid (2006), Rada, et. al. 1989, Patwardhan (2003), Jiang & Conrath
    (1997), Resnik (1995), Lin (1998), Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) and a
    simple path based measure.

TESTING PLATFORMS
    UMLS-Similarity has been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris,
    primarily using Perl and the C shell (csh).

REQUIREMENTS
    UMLS-Similarity REQUIRES that the following software be installed. More
    details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

    --CPAN modules UMLS::Interface

PROGGRAMMING LANGUAGES
  Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)
    Perl is freely available at:

    <http://www.perl.org>

    It is very likely that you will already have Perl installed if you are
    using a Unix/Linux based system.

CPAN MODULES
  UMLS-Interface
    Please see the UMLS-Interface documentation.

INSTALLATION
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install UMLS-Similarity

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

                    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs LIB=/home/lib
                    make
                    make test
                    make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /home/lib in your PERL5LIB environment variable to
    access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install UMLS-Similarity
    into system directories via : perl Makefile.PL make make install make
    clean

    The exact location of where UMLS-Similarity will be installed depends on
    your system configuration. A message will be printed out after 'make
    install' telling your exactly where it was installed.

USING vector.pm
    The vector measure is in a pre-beta stage at this point. It requires the
    BerkelyDB which I apologize because after installing the UMLS into MySQL
    the last thing you really want to do is install another database. This
    shouldn't be as painful and I promise to work on getting this updated so
    you will no longer be required to do this.

    You can download BerkleyDB from here:

    <http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.ht
    ml>

    You can either chose the encripted or non-encripted version. I chose the
    non-ensripted because it was smaller. I am using linux (ubuntu to be
    specific) so I downloaded the following file:

              Berkeley DB 4.7.25NC.tar.gz

    Extract the package using gunzip and tar

              % gunzip db-4.7.25.NC.tar.gz
              % tar -xf db-4.7.25.NC.tar

    In the directory, there is a file called doc/index.html which has the
    installation instructions. I installed it using the following steps and
    series of commands:

              %  cd build_unix 
              %  ../dist/configure
              %  make
              %  sudo make install

    Next, download the BerkleyDB.pm module from CPAN:

    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/BerkeleyDB/>

    The installation directions are in the README. Below are the steps and
    commands that I used to install the package.

    Extract the package using gunzip and tar % gunzip BerkeleyDB-0.38.tar.gz
    % tar -xf BerkeleyDB-0.38.tar

    In the BerkeleyDB-0.38 directory, you are going to have to modify the
    config.in file.

    First, change the path of the INCLUDE variable to point to the directory
    where db.h is installed. For example:

            INCLUDE = /home/bridget/programs/db-4.7.25.NC/build_unix

    Second, change the path of the LIB veriable to point to the directory
    where the libdb is installed. For example:

            LIB     = /home/bridget/programs/db-4.7.25.NC/build_unix
    Then continue on with the typical perl module install:

           % perl Makefile.PL
           % make
           % sudo make install

    Theoretically, that should do it. As I said before this is the beta
    version so in the near future these additional steps will not be
    necessary to use the vector measure module.

    To use this method you will need to specify the --dbfile option, which
    is BerkleyDB file that contains the vector information. If you need a
    test file for this please email me at: bthomson@cs.umn.edu
