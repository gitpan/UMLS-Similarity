    UMLS-Similarity

TESTING PLATFORMS
    UMLS-Interface has been developed and tested on Linux and Solaris,
    primarily using Perl and the C shell (csh).

REQUIREMENTS
    UMLS-Interface REQUIRES that the following software be installed. More
    details on how to obtain and install appear below.

    --Programming Languages Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)

    --CPAN modules UMLS::Interface

PROGGRAMMING LANGUAGES
  Perl (version 5.8.5 or better)
    Perl is freely available at http://www.perl.org. It is very likely that
    you will already have Perl installed if you are using a Unix/Linux based
    system.

CPAN MODULES
  UMLS-Interface
    Please see the UMLS-Interface documentation.

INSTALLATION
    If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local
    install, you can install via:

    perl -MCPAN -e shell > install UMLS-Similarity

    If not, you can, "manually" install by downloading the *.tar.gz file,
    unpacking, and executing the following commands.

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/space/kulka020/Bit-Vector
    LIB=/space/kulka020/MyPerlLib make make test make install

    Note that the PREFIX and LIB settings are just examples to help you
    create a local install, if you do not have supervisor (su) access.

    You must include /space/kulka020/MyPerlLib in your PERL5LIB environment
    variable to access this module when running.

    If you have the super-user access, then you can install UMLS-Similarity
    into system directories via :

                    perl Makefile.PL
                    make
                    make install
                    make clean

    The exact location of where UMLS-Similarity will be installed depends on
    your system configuration. A message will be printed out after 'make
    install' telling your exactly where it was installed.
