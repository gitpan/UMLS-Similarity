=head1 NAME

UMLS::Similarity - A suite of Perl modules that implement a number 
of semantic similarity measures. The measures use the UMLS-Interface 
module to access the UMLS to generate similarity scores between 
concepts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use UMLS::Interface;
  
 use UMLS::Similarity::lch;
 use UMLS::Similarity::path;

 my $umls = UMLS::Interface->new(); 
 die "Unable to create UMLS::Interface object.\n" if(!$umls);
 ($errCode, $errString) = $umls->getError();
 die "$errString\n" if($errCode);

 my $lch = UMLS::Similarity::lch->new($umls);
 die "Unable to create measure object.\n" if(!$lch);
   
 my $path = UMLS::Similarity::path->new($umls);
 die "Unable to create measure object.\n" if(!$path);

 my $cui1 = "C0005767";
 my $cui2 = "C0007634";

 @ts1 = $umls->getTermList($cui1);
 my $term1 = pop @ts1;

 @ts2 = $umls->getTermList($cui2);
 my $term2 = pop @ts2;

 my $lvalue = $lch->getRelatedness($cui1, $cui2);
 my $pvalue = $path->getRelatedness($cui1, $cui2);

 print "The lch similarity between $cui1 ($term1) and $cui2 ($term2) is $lvalue\n";
 print "The path similarity between $cui1 ($term1) and $cui2 ($term2) is $pvalue\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package consists of Perl modules along with supporting Perl
programs that implement the semantic relatedness measures described by
Leacock & Chodorow (1998), Wu & Palmer (1994), Nguyen and Al-Mubaid 
(2006), Rada, et. al. 1989, Patwardhan (2003) and a simple path based 
measure.

The Perl modules are designed as objects with methods that take as
input two concepts. The semantic relatedness of these concepts is 
returned by these methods. A quantitative measure of the degree to
which two word senses are related has wide ranging applications in
numerous areas, such as word sense disambiguation, information
retrieval, etc. For example, in order to determine which sense of a
given word is being used in a particular context, the sense having the
highest relatedness with its context word senses is most likely to be
the sense being used. Similarly, in information retrieval, retrieving
documents containing highly related concepts are more likely to have
higher precision and recall values.

The following sections describe the organization of this software
package and how to use it. A few typical examples are given to help
clearly understand the usage of the modules and the supporting
utilities.
