=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module computes the semantic similarity of two concepts in 
the UMLS according to a method described by Jiang and Conrath (1997). 
This measure is based on a combination of using edge counts in the UMLS 
'is-a' hierarchy and using the information content values of the concepts, 
as describedin the paper by Jiang and Conrath. Their measure, however, 
computes values that indicate the semantic distance between words (as 
opposed to their semantic similarity). In this implementation of the 
measure we invert the value so as to obtain a measure of semantic 
relatedness. Other issues that arise due to this inversion (such as 
handling of zero values in the denominator) have been taken care of 
as special cases.

The IC of a concept is defined as the negative log of the probabilty 
of the concept. 

To use this measure, a propagation file containing the probability 
of a CUI for each of the CUIs from the source(s) specified in the 
configuration file. The format for this file is as follows:

 C0000039<>0.00003951
 C0000052<>0.00003951
 C0000084<>0.00003951
 C0000096<>0.00003951

A larger of example of this file can be found in the icpropagation file 
in the samples/ directory. 

A propagation file can be created using the create-icfrequency.pl and 
the create-icpropagation.pl programs in the utils/ directory. The 
create-icfrequency.pl program takes plain text and returns a list of 
CUIs that are mapped to the text and the CUIs frequency counts. This 
file can then be used by the create-icpropagation.pl program to create 
a file containing a list of CUIs and their probability counts, or used 
directly by the umls-similarity.pl program which will calculate the 
probability of a concept on the fly. 

The probability of each of the CUIs is dependendent on the set of 
source(s) and relations specified in the configuration file - You 
can not mix and match.

=head1 PROPAGATION

The Information Content (IC) is  defined as the negative log 
of the probability of a concept. The probability of a concept, 
c, is determine by summing the probability of the concept 
(P(c)) ocurring in some text plus the probability its decendants 
(P(d)) occuring in some text:

P(c*) = P(c) + \sum_{d\exists decendant(c)} P(d)

The initial probability of a concept (P(c)) and its decendants 
(P(d)) is obtained by dividing the number of times a concept is 
seen in the corpus (freq(d)) by the total number of concepts (N):

P(d) = freq(d) / N

Not all of the concepts in the taxonomy will be seen in the corpus. 
We have the option to use Laplace smoothing, where the frequency 
count of each of the concepts in the taxonomy is incremented by one. 
The advantage of doing this is that it avoides having a concept that 
has a probability of zero. The disadvantage is that it can shift the 
overall probability mass of the concepts from what is actually seen 
in the corpus. 


=head1 USAGE

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as classes
that expose the following methods:
  new()
  getRelatedness()

=head1 TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLES

To create an object of the jcn measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the perl program. 

   use UMLS::Similarity::jcn;
   $measure = UMLS::Similarity::jcn->new($interface);

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar
variable '$measure'. '$interface' contains an interface object that
should have been created earlier in the program (UMLS-Interface). 

If the 'new' method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would 
be undefined. 

To find the semantic relatedness of the concept 'blood' (C0005767) and
the concept 'cell' (C0007634) using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('C0005767', 'C0007634');
