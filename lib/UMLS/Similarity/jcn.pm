=head1 NAME

UMLS::Similarity::jcn - Perl module for computing semantic relatedness
of concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) using the 
method described by Jiang and Conrath 1997.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UMLS::Interface;
  use UMLS::Similarity::jcn;

  my $option_hash{"propogation"} = $propogation_file;

  my $umls = UMLS::Interface->new(\%option_hash); 
  die "Unable to create UMLS::Interface object.\n" if(!$umls);
  ($errCode, $errString) = $umls->getError();
  die "$errString\n" if($errCode);

  my $jcn = UMLS::Similarity::jcn->new($umls);
  die "Unable to create measure object.\n" if(!$jcn);
  
  my $cui1 = "C0005767";
  my $cui2 = "C0007634";
	
  @ts1 = $umls->getTermList($cui1);
  my $term1 = pop @ts1;

  @ts2 = $umls->getTermList($cui2);
  my $term2 = pop @ts2;

  my $value = $jcn->getRelatedness($cui1, $cui2);

  print "The similarity between $cui1 ($term1) and $cui2 ($term2) is $value\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module computes the semantic relatedness of two concepts in 
the UMLS according to a method described by Jiang and Conrath (1997). 
This measure is based on a combination of using edge counts in the UMLS 
'is-a' hierarchy and using the information content values of the concepts, 
as describedin the paper by Jiang and Conrath. Their measure, however, 
computes values that indicate the semantic distance between words (as 
opposed to theirsemantic relatedness). In this implementation of the 
measure we invert the value so as to obtain a measure of semantic 
relatedness. Other issues that arise due to this inversion (such as 
handling of zero values in the denominator) have been taken care of 
as special cases.

=head1 USAGE

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as classes
that expose the following methods:
  new()
  getRelatedness()
  getError()
  getTraceString()

See the UMLS::Similarity(3) documentation for details of these methods.

=head1 TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLES

To create an object of the jcn measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the perl program. 

   use UMLS::Similarity::jcn;
   $measure = UMLS::Similarity::jcn->new($interface);

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar
variable '$measure'. '$interface' contains an interface object that
should have been created earlier in the program (UMLS-Interface). 

If the 'new' method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would 
be undefined. This, as well as any other error/warning may be tested.

   die "Unable to create object.\n" if(!defined $measure);
   ($err, $errString) = $measure->getError();
   die $errString."\n" if($err);

To find the semantic relatedness of the concept 'blood' (C0005767) and
the concept 'cell' (C0007634) using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('C0005767', 'C0007634');
  
To get traces for the above computation:

   print $measure->getTraceString();

However, traces must be enabled using configuration files. By default
traces are turned off.
