=head1 NAME

UMLS::Similarity::cdist - Perl module for computing semantic relatedness
of concepts in the UMLS by simple edge counting proposed by Rada, et. al. 
(1989).

=head1 CITATION

 @article{Rada89,
  title={{Development and application of a metric on semantic nets}},
  author={Rada, R. and Mili, H. and Bicknell, E. and Blettner, M.},
  journal={IEEE transactions on systems, man and cybernetics},
  volume={19},
  number={1},
  pages={17--30},
  year={1989}
 }

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UMLS::Interface;
  use UMLS::Similarity::cdist;

  my $umls = UMLS::Interface->new(); 
  die "Unable to create UMLS::Interface object.\n" if(!$umls);
  ($errCode, $errString) = $umls->getError();
  die "$errString\n" if($errCode);

  my $cdist = UMLS::Similarity::cdist->new($umls);
  die "Unable to create measure object.\n" if(!$cdist);
  
  my $cui1 = "C0005767";
  my $cui2 = "C0007634";
	
  @ts1 = $umls->getTermList($cui1);
  my $term1 = pop @ts1;

  @ts2 = $umls->getTermList($cui2);
  my $term2 = pop @ts2;

  my $value = $cdist->getRelatedness($cui1, $cui2);

  print "The similarity between $cui1 ($term1) and $cui2 ($term2) is $value\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the concepts being compared are the same, then the resulting 
similarity score will be 1.  For example, the score for C0005767 
and C0005767 is 1.

The relatedness value returned by C<getRelatedness()> is the 
number of edges between the two concepts.

=head1 USAGE

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as 
classes that expose the following methods:
  new()
  getRelatedness()
  getError()

=head1 TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLES

To create an object of the cdist measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the perl program. 

   use UMLS::Similarity::cdist;
   $measure = UMLS::Similarity::cdist->new($interface);

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar
variable '$measure'. '$interface' contains an interface object that
should have been created earlier in the program (UMLS-Interface).

If the 'new' method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would 
be undefined. This, as well as any other error/warning may be tested.

   die "Unable to create object.\n" if(!defined $measure);
   ($err, $errString) = $measure->getError();
   die $errString."\n" if($err);

To find the semantic relatedness of the concept 'blood' (C0005767) and
the concept 'cell' (C0007634) using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('C0005767', 'C0007634');
