=head1 NAME

UMLS::Similarity::random - Perl module for computing a random baseline 
by assigning a random number between zero and one as the similarity score.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UMLS::Interface;
  use UMLS::Similarity::random;

  my $umls = UMLS::Interface->new(); 
  die "Unable to create UMLS::Interface object.\n" if(!$umls);
  ($errCode, $errString) = $umls->getError();
  die "$errString\n" if($errCode);

  my $random = UMLS::Similarity::random->new($umls);
  die "Unable to create measure object.\n" if(!$random);
  
  my $cui1 = "C0005767";
  my $cui2 = "C0007634";
	
  @ts1 = $umls->getTermList($cui1);
  my $term1 = pop @ts1;

  @ts2 = $umls->getTermList($cui2);
  my $term2 = pop @ts2;

  my $value = $random->getRelatedness($cui1, $cui2);

  print "The similarity between $cui1 ($term1) and $cui2 ($term2) is $value\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module assigns a random number between zero and one as the 
semantic relatedness of two concepts in the UMLS 

=head1 USAGE

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as classes
that expose the following methods:
  new()
  getRelatedness()
  getError()

=head1 TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLES

To create an object of the random measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the perl program. 

   use UMLS::Similarity::random;
   $measure = UMLS::Similarity::random->new($interface);

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar
variable '$measure'. '$interface' contains an interface object that
should have been created earlier in the program (UMLS-Interface). 

If the 'new' method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would 
be undefined. This, as well as any other error/warning may be tested.

   die "Unable to create object.\n" if(!defined $measure);
   ($err, $errString) = $measure->getError();
   die $errString."\n" if($err);

To find the semantic relatedness of the concept 'blood' (C0005767) and
the concept 'cell' (C0007634) using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('C0005767', 'C0007634');
