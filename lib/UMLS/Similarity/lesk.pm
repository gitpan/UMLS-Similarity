=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module computes the semantic relatedness of two concepts in 
the UMLS according to a method described by Banerjee and Pedersen(2002). 
The relatedness measure proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen is and
adaptation of Lesk's dictionary-based word sense disambiguation algorithm.  

--defraw option is a flag for the lesk measure. The definitions 
used are 'cleaned'. If the --defraw flag is set they will not be cleaned, 
and it will leave the definitions in their "raw" form. 

--dictfile option is a dictionary file for the lesk measure. It 
contains the 'definitions' of a concept which would be used rather 
than the definitions from the UMLS. 

--stoplist option is a word list file for the lesk measure. The words
in the file should be removed from the definition. In the stop list file, 
each word is in the regular expression format. A stop word sample file 
is under the samples folder which is called stoplist-nsp.regex.

--stem option is a flag for the lesk measure. If we the --stem flag
is set, the words of the definition are stemmed by the the Porter Stemming
algorithm.  


=head1 USAGE

The semantic relatedness modules in this distribution are built as classes
that expose the following methods:
  new()
  getRelatedness()

=head1 TYPICAL USAGE EXAMPLES

To create an object of the lesk measure, we would have the following
lines of code in the perl program. 

   use UMLS::Similarity::lesk;
   $measure = UMLS::Similarity::lesk->new($interface);

The reference of the initialized object is stored in the scalar
variable '$measure'. '$interface' contains an interface object that
should have been created earlier in the program (UMLS-Interface). 

If the 'new' method is unable to create the object, '$measure' would 
be undefined. 

To find the semantic relatedness of the concept 'blood' (C0005767) and
the concept 'cell' (C0007634) using the measure, we would write
the following piece of code:

   $relatedness = $measure->getRelatedness('C0005767', 'C0007634');

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTION

The UMLS-Interface package takes a configuration file to determine 
which sources and relations to use when obtaining the extended 
definitions. We call the definition used by the measure, the extended 
definition because this may include definitions from related concepts. 

The format of the configuration file is as follows:

SABDEF :: <include|exclude> <source1, source2, ... sourceN>

RELDEF :: <include|exclude> <relation1, relation2, ... relationN>

For example, if we wanted to use the definitions from MSH vocabulary 
and we only wanted the definition of the CUI and the definitions of the 
CUIs SIB relation, the configuration file would be:

SABDEF :: include MSH
RELDEF :: include CUI, SIB

Note: RELDEF takes any of MRREL relations and two special 'relations':

      1. CUI which refers to the CUIs definition

      2. TERM which refers to the terms associated with the CUI


If you go to the configuration file directory, there will 
be example configuration files for the different runs that 
you have performed.

For more information about the configuration options please 
see the README.
